WANT: A model to classify whether an isolate could make someone resistant to beta-lactam drug. The classification would be S, I, or R.


Preprossesing: load in all the data, and:

1. convert all genes to -1 (positive) or 1 (negative)
2. Find and label isolate as containing ESBL (0), containing carbapenemase (1), both (2), or neither (3)
3. Convert all isolate Amikacin values for each isolate into a -1 (R), 0 (I), or 1 (S)
4. Find and record all MIC values for the isolates.
5. Possibly remove any isolates that are missing values (or use dropout latter on inputs while training to train for missing inputs)

Actual input:

All genes from 1
The value from 2
MIC s from 4

Label: values from 3

Output: Either -1 (resistant), 0 (Intermediate), or 1 (Susceptible)



This can all be done easily on a Neural Network. The good thing is we have drugs that are not beta-lactam, so we cannot use those in our training dataset, but we can use them in our test and prove that it should always read -1, or we can make a separate output for 2 (NA) maybe and include these in the dataset.



If they want an analysis on demographic profiles to find trends with the genetics than we can have 2 people work on that, and combine the 2 to have an analysis on resistant isolates based on certain profiles. However, I feel this is pushing a little, and they may not want that. We would not need any demographic information for the Neural Network, so unless they want this then we would not use that data.
