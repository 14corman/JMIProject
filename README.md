## How to work on part
If you want to work on something, make a separate branch for exactly what you are adding. When you are finished then merge it back into the master and delete the branch.

For example, say I wanted to work on the RSI method in the main python file. Then I would create a branch named RSI and do all my work from that branch. If I wanted to make a branch to add other files, then I would name the branch those files.

# Problems and discussions
If you want to work on a part, or discuss something with the team then go to the "issues" tab and make a new issue their. Here are the labels that issues should have:

1. assign: This will be assigning a part to a team member
2. help: This will be to ask the group about a problem
3. opinion: Something to ask group members about an opinion about some part of the project

The other labels are already defined and show up when you go to add a label to an issue.
