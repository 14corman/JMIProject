## How to work on part
If you want to work on something, make a separate branch for exactly what you are adding. When you are finished then merge it back into the master and delete the branch.

For example, say I wanted to work on the RSI method in the main python file. Then I would create a branch named RSI and do all my work from that branch. If I wanted to make a branch to add other files, then I would name the branch those files.

## Problems and discussions
If you want to work on a part, or discuss something with the team then go to the "issues" tab and make a new issue their. Here are the labels that issues should have:

1. assign: This will be assigning a part to a team member
2. help: This will be to ask the group about a problem
3. opinion: Something to ask group members about an opinion about some part of the project

The other labels are already defined and show up when you go to add a label to an issue.

## How to merge branches
If you have a branch you are working on, and finish and want to merge back with master, then merge your branch into master. If there are any conflicts, then do not push the merge to master. Instead, email Cory, and he will fix the conflicts and merge. Otherwise, if there are no conflicts then you can go ahead and push the merge to master.

One your merge and push, you can delete the branch you were working on.
